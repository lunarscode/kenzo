    <h1>Kenzo.</h1><p>Kenzo is innocent! Here's why.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It was all consensual, as confirmed by the so-called "victim" literal ages after it happened.</li>
      <li>He is not Doctor Strange, he didn't manipulate anyone.</li>
      <li>Age difference an issue? He was 17, she was 15, get over it, it's not a 17 year old and an 11 year old.</li>
      <li>Overall, let's just forget about the situation.</li>
    </ul>
